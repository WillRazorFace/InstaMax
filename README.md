# InstaMax
A script written in Python with the selenium framework to automate boring things to do on Instagram.
## Before use
Install all necessary packages for use from the file "requirements.txt" typing on your console `pip install -r requirements.txt`. The selenium framework requires your browser driver so that tasks can be automated, as you can read [here](https://selenium-python.readthedocs.io/installation.html#drivers). Download your browser's driver.
## Usage
Let the bot **like the posts**, **follow users**, **stop following non-followers** without worrying about getting their hands dirty and **watch the results happen**. You can also use some "useful" methods to search for a specific user in an account's follower list, for example. InstaMax can be used in Chrome, Firefox and Safari browsers. After you have downloaded the driver, start the script by typing into your console `py(thon3.x) instamax.py`. A small configuration will start and you can change these values later. The script contains a menu that is easy to understand and without much pollution so just choose the option and provide the necessary information. I wish you good growth!
